# Pandas-Challenge
Three conclusions that I can draw from the data is that 
1) There is by far a higher number of male players compared to female and non-disclosed/other
2) The majority of people playing this game are between 15-24
3)Although overall there are more males playing this game, females on average spend more on in game purchases than males
